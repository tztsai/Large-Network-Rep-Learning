## DD2434 project: Large Network representation learning

Paper:

Megha Khosla, Vinay Setty, and Avishek Anand. "A Comparative Study for Unsupervised Network Representation Learning." IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (2019)

Tasks:

1. Implement the following methods discussed in the paper: DeepWalk, Node2vec, Line-1, NetMF, and GraphSage. Use of standard ML and DL languages is allowed.

2. Collect all the datasets presented in the paper. Search for a few additional datasets, if possible from different domains. Try to include new datasets that are at least as large as the ones in the original paper.

3. Evaluate the different methods on the data you collected with respect to the tasks of link prediction and node classification.

4. Discuss whether the results of the paper are reproducible in your experiments and whether they generalize to the new datasets you tested.

5. Discuss the original paper in terms of approach, methodology, and conclusions.

6. Summarize the most interesting things that you learned in this project.
